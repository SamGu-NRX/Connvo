# Implementation Tasks

- [x] 1. Create shared OpenAPI example fixtures in `test/convex` and export for reuse.
- [x] 2. Add operation metadata overrides (friendly names, example bindings) consumable by the enhancement script.
- [x] 3. Update `scripts/enhance-openapi.ts` to merge overrides, docstrings, and shared examples into summaries/descriptions/examples.
- [x] 4. Regenerate and validate `docs/api-reference/convex-openapi.yaml`, ensuring Mintlify-friendly output.
