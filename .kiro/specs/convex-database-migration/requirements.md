# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating LinkedUp's current database architecture from Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL/Supabase to Convex, a modern reactive backend-as-a-service platform. LinkedUp is a professional networking application that currently features basic matching and video calling, but requires significant enhancement with advanced real-time capabilities:

**Current Features:**

- Basic user profiles and interests management
- Simulated smart matching (currently mock implementation)
- Video meetings with Stream integration
- Basic chat and meeting controls

**New Advanced Features to Implement:**

- **Pre-call Idea Generation**: AI-powered conversation starters and meeting preparation based on participant profiles
- **Real-time In-call Features**: Live conversation prompts, shared meeting notes, and collaborative tools
- **Post-call Insights**: Transcription analysis, meeting summaries, and connection recommendations
- **Live Transcription**: Real-time speech-to-text with participant-specific accuracy
- **Collaborative Notes**: Shared, real-time note-taking visible only to meeting participants

The migration aims to achieve enterprise-grade robustness, consistency, scalability, and performance while implementing these advanced real-time features using Convex's reactive architecture, WebSocket-based live updates, and TypeScript-first development practices.
