# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for comprehensive documentation enhancement across the entire LinkedUp Convex backend. The goal is to ensure every public query, mutation, and action has rich docstrings with realistic examples that are validated by tests and automatically integrated into the OpenAPI specification. This builds upon the existing Mintlify documentation infrastructure by ensuring the source functions themselves are thoroughly documented.

## Glossary

- **Convex Backend**: The TypeScript-based backend runtime located in the `convex/` directory
- **Docstring**: JSDoc-style comment block containing `@summary`, `@description`, and `@example` tags
- **Public Function**: Any exported query, mutation, or action accessible through `@convex/_generated/api`
- **OpenAPI Spec**: The machine-readable API documentation file at `docs/api-reference/convex-openapi.yaml`
- **Documentation Pipeline**: The automated workflow that generates and validates API documentation
- **Test Coverage**: Automated tests that validate docstring examples match actual function behavior
- **Example Block**: A labeled JSON payload within a docstring demonstrating request/response patterns

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Docstring Coverage

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want every public Convex function to have comprehensive documentation, so that I understand how to use each endpoint without reading implementation code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the documentation audit runs, THE Documentation System SHALL identify all public queries, mutations, and actions in the Convex backend
2. WHEN a public function lacks a docstring, THE Documentation System SHALL report it as a coverage gap
3. THE Documentation System SHALL ensure every public function has a leading JSDoc comment block with `@summary` and `@description` tags
4. WHERE a function has complex behavior, THE Documentation System SHALL include detailed `@description` content explaining parameters, return values, and side effects
5. THE Documentation System SHALL exclude internal functions and template files from public documentation requirements

### Requirement 2: Realistic Example Payloads

**User Story:** As a developer integrating with LinkedUp, I want to see realistic request and response examples for each endpoint, so that I can quickly understand the data structures and implement correct API calls.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation System SHALL include at least one `@example request` block for every public function showing valid input arguments
2. THE Documentation System SHALL include at least one `@example response` block for every public function showing the expected return value
3. WHERE a function can return errors, THE Documentation System SHALL include `@example response-error` blocks demonstrating error scenarios
4. THE Documentation System SHALL format all example payloads as valid JSON within fenced code blocks
5. THE Documentation System SHALL use realistic data values (IDs, timestamps, user data) that match actual system behavior

### Requirement 3: Test-Validated Examples

**User Story:** As a maintainer, I want docstring examples to be validated by automated tests, so that documentation stays accurate as the codebase evolves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a docstring includes example payloads, THE Test Suite SHALL include corresponding test cases that exercise the same inputs and outputs
2. THE Test Suite SHALL fail if docstring examples diverge from actual function behavior
3. WHERE new examples are added to docstrings, THE Test Suite SHALL be extended with matching test coverage
4. THE Test Suite SHALL use deterministic test data (stable IDs, timestamps) to enable reliable comparison with docstring examples
5. THE Test Suite SHALL normalize dynamic values before comparing test results to docstring fixtures

### Requirement 4: Automated Documentation Generation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want documentation to be automatically generated and validated, so that the OpenAPI spec stays synchronized with code changes without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the documentation pipeline runs, THE Documentation System SHALL parse all docstrings and extract `@summary`, `@description`, and `@example` blocks
2. THE Documentation System SHALL inject docstring metadata into the generated OpenAPI specification at `docs/api-reference/convex-openapi.yaml`
3. THE Documentation System SHALL validate the generated OpenAPI spec using Redocly validation rules
4. WHEN docstring examples contain invalid JSON, THE Documentation System SHALL report validation errors with specific file and line references
5. THE Documentation System SHALL execute via `pnpm run update:api-docs:dev` command and complete without errors

### Requirement 5: Continuous Integration

**User Story:** As a team member, I want documentation updates to be automatically committed when code changes, so that the API reference stays current without manual updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the repository, THE CI System SHALL execute the documentation pipeline via GitHub Actions
2. THE CI System SHALL regenerate `docs/api-reference/convex-openapi.yaml` with updated docstring content
3. IF the OpenAPI spec changes, THE CI System SHALL automatically commit the updated file to the repository
4. THE CI System SHALL fail the build if documentation validation errors occur
5. THE CI System SHALL provide clear error messages indicating which functions lack required documentation

### Requirement 6: Domain-Specific Documentation Standards

**User Story:** As a developer working on specific features, I want documentation standards tailored to different backend domains, so that domain-specific patterns and conventions are consistently documented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation System SHALL define specific example requirements for authentication functions (showing token handling, permission checks)
2. THE Documentation System SHALL define specific example requirements for real-time functions (showing subscription patterns, reactive updates)
3. THE Documentation System SHALL define specific example requirements for AI functions (showing embedding generation, vector search results)
4. THE Documentation System SHALL define specific example requirements for meeting functions (showing lifecycle states, participant management)
5. WHERE domain-specific patterns exist, THE Documentation System SHALL provide template examples for common scenarios

### Requirement 7: Documentation Quality Metrics

**User Story:** As a technical lead, I want to track documentation coverage and quality metrics, so that I can identify gaps and ensure consistent documentation standards across the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation System SHALL report the percentage of public functions with complete docstrings
2. THE Documentation System SHALL report the percentage of docstrings with validated examples
3. THE Documentation System SHALL identify functions with missing `@summary`, `@description`, or `@example` tags
4. THE Documentation System SHALL track documentation coverage trends over time
5. THE Documentation System SHALL fail quality gates if coverage falls below defined thresholds

### Requirement 8: Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer adding new Convex functions, I want clear guidance and tooling support for writing docstrings, so that I can easily maintain documentation standards without extensive manual effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Documentation System SHALL provide template docstrings for common function patterns (CRUD operations, search queries, batch operations)
2. THE Documentation System SHALL validate docstring format during development and provide immediate feedback
3. WHERE docstring syntax is incorrect, THE Documentation System SHALL provide actionable error messages with correction suggestions
4. THE Documentation System SHALL integrate with IDE tooling to show docstring examples in autocomplete and hover tooltips
5. THE Documentation System SHALL document the docstring format and example requirements in a developer guide
