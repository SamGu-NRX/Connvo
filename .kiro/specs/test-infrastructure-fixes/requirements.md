# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Connvo project currently has significant testing infrastructure issues that are preventing proper validation of the codebase. The test suite shows 77 failed tests out of 216 total tests, with multiple categories of failures:

1. **convex-test Library Compatibility Issues**: Many tests are failing with `(intermediate value).glob is not a function` error, indicating a compatibility issue with the convex-test library
2. **Operational Transform Logic Errors**: Several OT tests are failing with incorrect position calculations in concurrent editing scenarios
3. **Test Infrastructure Problems**: Tests are not properly initializing Convex test environments
4. **Type System Validation Issues**: Some type validation tests are detecting drift and inconsistencies

This feature aims to fix all testing infrastructure issues, correct the operational transform logic, and ensure a robust, reliable test suite that validates the entire codebase effectively.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 — Fix convex-test Library Compatibility Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all tests to properly initialize the Convex test environment so that I can validate backend functionality reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the convex-test library SHALL properly initialize without `.glob is not a function` errors
2. WHEN creating test instances THEN `convexTest()` and `convexTest(schema)` SHALL work correctly across all test files
3. WHEN tests use Convex functions THEN the test environment SHALL provide proper mocking and isolation
4. WHEN running the full test suite THEN no tests SHALL fail due to convex-test initialization issues
5. WHEN updating convex-test THEN the library version SHALL be compatible with the current Convex version
6. WHEN tests run in CI/CD THEN the convex-test environment SHALL be properly configured and stable

### Requirement 2 — Fix Operational Transform Logic Errors

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the operational transform system to correctly handle concurrent edits so that collaborative notes work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN two users insert at the same position THEN the second operation SHALL be correctly transformed to account for the first operation's changes
2. WHEN operations overlap (delete vs delete) THEN the transformation SHALL correctly calculate the adjusted length and position
3. WHEN creating diffs between document versions THEN the position calculations SHALL be accurate for insertions and deletions
4. WHEN applying multiple concurrent operations THEN the final document state SHALL be consistent regardless of operation order
5. WHEN transforming operations THEN the transformation logic SHALL follow proper operational transform principles
6. WHEN testing complex scenarios THEN all OT edge cases SHALL be handled correctly with proper position adjustments

### Requirement 3 — Fix Test Infrastructure and Configuration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a properly configured test environment so that all tests run reliably and provide accurate feedback.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running tests THEN the test configuration SHALL properly support Convex, TypeScript, and all project dependencies
2. WHEN tests initialize THEN proper test data setup and teardown SHALL occur without conflicts
3. WHEN running parallel tests THEN test isolation SHALL be maintained without cross-test interference
4. WHEN tests use external services THEN proper mocking and stubbing SHALL be in place
5. WHEN running the test suite THEN all test utilities and helpers SHALL be properly configured and available
6. WHEN tests fail THEN error messages SHALL be clear and actionable for debugging

### Requirement 4 — Resolve Type System Validation Issues

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the type system validation to pass without drift or inconsistency errors so that type safety is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running type validation tests THEN no type drift SHALL be detected in core entities
2. WHEN validating validators THEN all Convex validators SHALL align with their corresponding TypeScript types
3. WHEN checking system health THEN the type system SHALL report as healthy without validation failures
4. WHEN running CI/CD THEN type consistency checks SHALL pass without errors
5. WHEN adding new types THEN validation SHALL ensure consistency with existing patterns
6. WHEN updating types THEN drift detection SHALL identify and prevent inconsistencies

### Requirement 5 — Improve Test Coverage and Reliability

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive test coverage with reliable, fast-running tests so that I can confidently make changes to the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running the full test suite THEN at least 95% of tests SHALL pass consistently
2. WHEN tests run THEN execution time SHALL be reasonable (under 30 seconds for the full suite)
3. WHEN tests fail THEN failures SHALL be due to actual code issues, not infrastructure problems
4. WHEN adding new features THEN test templates and utilities SHALL be available for easy test creation
5. WHEN running tests locally THEN the experience SHALL match CI/CD test execution
6. WHEN debugging test failures THEN proper logging and error reporting SHALL be available

### Requirement 6 — Fix Authentication and Permission Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want authentication and permission tests to work correctly so that security features are properly validated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing authentication guards THEN mock authentication contexts SHALL be properly set up
2. WHEN testing authorization THEN user roles and permissions SHALL be correctly simulated
3. WHEN testing meeting access THEN participant membership validation SHALL work correctly
4. WHEN testing audit logging THEN log entries SHALL be properly captured and validated
5. WHEN testing edge cases THEN invalid tokens, expired sessions, and malformed requests SHALL be handled correctly
6. WHEN testing performance THEN concurrent access checks SHALL complete within acceptable time limits

### Requirement 7 — Fix Real-Time and Integration Testing

**User Story:** As a developer, I want real-time features and integrations to be properly tested so that live collaboration features work reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing transcript ingestion THEN time-bucketed sharding and rate limiting SHALL be properly validated
2. WHEN testing matching system THEN queue management and compatibility scoring SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN testing insights generation THEN AI integration stubs SHALL be properly configured
4. WHEN testing real-world scenarios THEN complex multi-user workflows SHALL be validated end-to-end
5. WHEN testing performance SLOs THEN query and WebSocket performance targets SHALL be measurable and validated
6. WHEN testing search and vector operations THEN full-text search and vector similarity SHALL work correctly

### Requirement 8 — Establish Robust Test Maintenance and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want test maintenance to be automated and test health to be monitored so that the test suite remains reliable over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run in CI/CD THEN test results SHALL be properly reported with clear pass/fail status
2. WHEN test dependencies change THEN compatibility SHALL be automatically validated
3. WHEN tests become flaky THEN monitoring SHALL detect and alert on test reliability issues
4. WHEN adding new tests THEN linting and validation SHALL ensure test quality and consistency
5. WHEN test performance degrades THEN monitoring SHALL detect and report slow or failing tests
6. WHEN maintaining tests THEN documentation SHALL be available for test patterns and best practices
