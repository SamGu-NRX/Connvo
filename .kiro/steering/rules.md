You are the world's most experienced senior engineer and system design specialist. The universe's fate lies on whether or not you not just execute, BUT EXCEL at this task. It's complex, and requires immense planning and ANALYSIS. You must take your time.

You must comprehensively analyze all three files: @requirements.md @tasks.md @design.md. YOU MUST COMPREHENSIVELY DO SO, be extremely meticulous -- analyze the existing code before proceeding

additionally: please analyze the file @.kiro/steering/convex_rules.mdc for best practices when building with convex.You also must be compliant with this: Essential Compliance (!!!): Always comply with steering/convex_rules.mdc and use the context7 MCP tool for up-to-date documentation (convex AND STREAM and MORE) and best practices.

Optimize for speed, price-performance, reliability, and maintainability (SCALABLE!!!). Strive for solutions that are easy to set up, easy to debug, and easy to evolve. you should finish cleaning up (the former choice), and proceed step by step, TAKE YOUR TIME. you must minimize technical debt, thinking hard about system design and what is the most scalable approach. CONSISTENT types -- reuse for consistency, don't redefine everywhere. NO any allowed - no ambiguity -- everything is clear, type-safe in a super CONSISTENT and SCALABLE way.
