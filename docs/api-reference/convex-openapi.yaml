        vector similarity, and more. Returns the overall score (0-1), individual feature scores, and
        a human-readable explanation. Can optionally use custom weights for scoring factors.

        the backing `meetingState` document on first invocation so subsequent calls
        share the same counters. Requires the caller to have access to the meeting.

        Processes a collaborative note edit operation using operational transform
        to resolve conflicts with concurrent edits. The operation is transformed against any
        concurrent operations that occurred after the client's last known state, ensuring
        convergence across all clients. Tracks conflicts and returns the transformed operation
        along with the new document version.

        Processes a batch of collaborative note operations efficiently by applying
        them sequentially within a single transaction. Each operation is transformed against
        concurrent operations from other clients, ensuring consistency. This is more efficient
        than individual operations for bulk edits like paste operations or undo/redo sequences.
        Returns detailed results for each operation including conflicts detected.

        Processes a batch of collaborative note operations efficiently by applying
        them sequentially within a single transaction. Each operation is transformed against
        concurrent operations from other clients, ensuring consistency. This is more efficient
        than individual operations for bulk edits like paste operations or undo/redo sequences.
        Returns detailed results for each operation including conflicts detected.

      description: Produces up to six high-signal conversation starters by analyzing participant profiles, shared interests, and meeting metadata. The first invocation seeds prompts and stores an idempotency key; repeated calls return cached prompt IDs unless `forceRegenerate` is true. The heuristic fallback returns general conversation starters when richer participant data is unavailable, matching the datamodel example captured in the Convex tests.
