# Welcome to the LinkedUp API

LinkedUp exposes a Convex-powered backend that lets you build collaborative, AI-assisted meeting experiences. Every query, mutation, and action is defined in TypeScript with validators so you can rely on a strongly typed contract when you consume the API or generate SDKs.

## What you can do

- Access real-time meeting data including participants, agendas, and post-call summaries.
- Trigger AI workflows for insights, prompts, and note generation on demand.
- Manage user accounts, authentication flows, and admin operations using the same OpenAPI surface.

## Where to start

1. Run `npm run update:api-docs` to pull the latest OpenAPI definition from your Convex deployment.
2. Review the [Authentication guide](authentication) to learn how to issue and use bearer tokens.
3. Explore the [API reference](api-reference/introduction) for endpoint details, request/response schemas, and live testing via the Mintlify playground.

If you are new to Convex, read the API reference introduction for a primer on the HTTP interface, including how Convex maps function identifiers to RESTful paths.
